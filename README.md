# Telios-AIO
One of my first projects, a chrome extension that automates the checkout process on profitable products within seconds.

### HOW TO USE:
- Download this zip, but you're only going to use the "telios_chrome" folder.
- Go into this url: chrome://extensions/
- Turn on developer mode if it isn't on already.
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Open the chrome extension and you will be prompted with a key ->
  - Type anything into the field and it'll let you through
  - I got rid of the authentication system since it is depreciated

This chrome extension will not log any data of yours to an external source. Everything that is logged is local and no one will have access to anything.
Source code for everything is available, nothing is obfuscated.

The purpose of this chrome extension was to help their users checkout a desired product in order to make a profit.
During the peak of it's era, it was highly functional and successful.

Currently, I am not sure what modules work but I'm sure the shopify autofill may not be depreciated.
